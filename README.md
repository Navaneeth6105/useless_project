### Project Description
Introducing "Bright Overload Calculator" ‚Äî a playful tool that operates only within a specific network, delivering answers in reverse format with a leading zero (e.g., 4 * 2 becomes 08). As a fun twist, it adjusts brightness based on WiFi strength, shifting from blindingly bright to nearly unreadable, creating an unforgettable (and slightly challenging) calculation experience!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Imagine a world where calculators are too straightforward, where math just happens without any 'surprise'. You type 10+5, and without drama, you get the expected result: 15. But this "boring accuracy" denies you the thrill of uncertainty, the adrenaline of misreading numbers and the joy of mathematical mystery.

Now, imagine you‚Äôre in a WiFi-rich environment, where every bar of signal strength shows its presence without any regard for 'sensitive eyes'. Calculators could use a bit more rebellion. Why settle for readable brightness when you could experience the full spectrum of 'retinal strain'?

Introducing the brightoverload calculator:
It not only inverts math results for an unexpected twist but also gauges WiFi strength, using signal power to control display brightness. Is it too bright or too dim? Yes. But think of the thrill in every calculation, every signal search. Finally, a calculator that challenges perception and provides an obstacle course for your senses!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
To solve this definitely pressing non-issue, we‚Äôve built the 'bright overload calculator' ‚Äîa masterpiece of twist against straightforward math and normal brightness levels.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. WiFi Detection Shenanigans: Our setup constantly searches for a specific WiFi network like an overly-attached friend. The moment it latches onto the signal, it springs to life. But this isn‚Äôt your ordinary calculator; it‚Äôs the opposite of helpful.

2. Backward Math Magic: When you punch in an equation, like "10 + 5," it laughs in the face of correct displays and spits out "51" instead. Why? Because regular answers are for mere mortals, and this calculator only gives reverse results to remind you that sometimes, logic should take a backseat.

3. Brightness Roulette: And as a bonus, we‚Äôve wired the display brightness to the strength of the WiFi signal. If you‚Äôre too close? Blinding light mode activates‚Äîgoodbye, retinas! Step away? It‚Äôll dim to the point of invisibility, making you question if it‚Äôs on. Now every calculation becomes a guessing game, with numbers hiding in the shadows or dazzling you out of nowhere.

In the end, we‚Äôve solved a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist by creating a WiFi-dependent, brightness-variable, backward-answering calculator. Finally, there‚Äôs a way to do math and not trust a single answer you see!

1. Calculator Operations (Arduino 1): Performs basic calculations based on keypad input.
   
2. Data Transmission: Sends numbers, operation type, and result to Arduino 2 via serial communication.

3. WiFi Signal Monitoring (ESP32): Detects WiFi signal strength of a specific network.

4. Signal Strength Transmission: Passes WiFi signal strength to Arduino 2.

5. Data Storage (Arduino 2): Stores received calculation and signal strength data.

6. LCD Contrast Adjustment: Adjusts LCD contrast based on WiFi signal strength.

7. Display Output: Shows results on LCD with modified contrast and reversed output.

8. Reset on 'Clear': Clears display for new calculations when "Clear" is pressed.

# Schematic & Circuit
![Circuit](https://github.com/Navaneeth6105/useless_project/blob/503e65e0224b220f63174a782f8ee9ee6e43f1fd/image.jpeg)
1. ESP32:
   - RX2 and D4 are connected to Arduino UNO's RX and TX pins, respectively, for serial communication.
   - D2 is connected to Arduino UNO‚Äôs digital pin 2.
   
2. LCD Display:
   - The LCD display (labeled ‚ÄúEnter the Numbers‚Äù) is connected to the Arduino UNO using the following pins:
     - R5, EN, D4, D5, D6, and D7 are connected to digital pins 8, 9, 12, 11, 5, and 4 on the Arduino UNO, respectively.
     - V0 controls the contrast, and VSS, VDD, and V0 are powered according to the display's requirements.

3. Arduino UNO:
   - Acts as the main controller, connecting the ESP32, LCD display, and keypad.
   - RX and TX pins are connected to the ESP32 for serial communication.
   
4. 4x4 Keypad:
   - Rows and columns of the keypad are connected to digital pins 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 on the Arduino UNO, allowing user input for numeric entry and operations.

![Schematic](https://github.com/Navaneeth6105/useless_project/blob/503e65e0224b220f63174a782f8ee9ee6e43f1fd/image.jpeg)
1. ESP32 Module: The ESP32 is used to detect specific WiFi networks. When the designated network is detected, it enables the Arduino UNO to function as a calculator.

2. Arduino UNO: Serves as the main controller, handling data from the ESP32, processing inputs from the keypad, and displaying output on the LCD. It communicates with the ESP32 through its RX (D0) and TX (D1) pins for WiFi signal information.

3. LCD Display: Shows prompts and results for the calculator. The display's data and control pins are connected to digital pins (8, 9, 12, 11, 5, 4) on the Arduino UNO.

4. 4x4 Keypad: Allows the user to input numbers and operations. The keypad is wired to the Arduino‚Äôs digital pins (2 to 9), where each row and column is mapped for unique key recognition.

In operation, the ESP32 detects the desired WiFi, enabling calculations on the Arduino. When the user enters calculations on the keypad, the Arduino processes the input and displays the result on the LCD‚Äîreversed.

This setup is a WiFi-enabled calculator for a "useless project." It consists of:

1. Keypad for inputting numbers and operations.
2. Arduino boards to handle calculations and control logic.
