### Project Description
Introducing "Bright Overload Calculator" ‚Äî a playful tool that operates only within a specific network, delivering answers in reverse format with a leading zero (e.g., 4 * 2 becomes 08). As a fun twist, it adjusts brightness based on WiFi strength, shifting from blindingly bright to nearly unreadable, creating an unforgettable (and slightly challenging) calculation experience!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Imagine a world where calculators are too straightforward, where math just happens without any 'surprise'. You type 10+5, and without drama, you get the expected result: 15. But this "boring accuracy" denies you the thrill of uncertainty, the adrenaline of misreading numbers and the joy of mathematical mystery.

Now, imagine you‚Äôre in a WiFi-rich environment, where every bar of signal strength shows its presence without any regard for 'sensitive eyes'. Calculators could use a bit more rebellion. Why settle for readable brightness when you could experience the full spectrum of 'retinal strain'?

Introducing the brightoverload calculator:
It not only inverts math results for an unexpected twist but also gauges WiFi strength, using signal power to control display brightness. Is it too bright or too dim? Yes. But think of the thrill in every calculation, every signal search. Finally, a calculator that challenges perception and provides an obstacle course for your senses!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
To solve this definitely pressing non-issue, we‚Äôve built the 'bright overload calculator' ‚Äîa masterpiece of twist against straightforward math and normal brightness levels.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. WiFi Detection Shenanigans: Our setup constantly searches for a specific WiFi network like an overly-attached friend. The moment it latches onto the signal, it springs to life. But this isn‚Äôt your ordinary calculator; it‚Äôs the opposite of helpful.

2. Backward Math Magic: When you punch in an equation, like "10 + 5," it laughs in the face of correct displays and spits out "51" instead. Why? Because regular answers are for mere mortals, and this calculator only gives reverse results to remind you that sometimes, logic should take a backseat.

3. Brightness Roulette: And as a bonus, we‚Äôve wired the display brightness to the strength of the WiFi signal. If you‚Äôre too close? Blinding light mode activates‚Äîgoodbye, retinas! Step away? It‚Äôll dim to the point of invisibility, making you question if it‚Äôs on. Now every calculation becomes a guessing game, with numbers hiding in the shadows or dazzling you out of nowhere.

In the end, we‚Äôve solved a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist by creating a WiFi-dependent, brightness-variable, backward-answering calculator. Finally, there‚Äôs a way to do math and not trust a single answer you see!
